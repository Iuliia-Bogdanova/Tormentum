                    There are two forces - Torment (antipode) and Light (deity). They are equal in their strength, eternity and aspirations. Deity and Torment act together and cannot live without each other.

                    The main world was formed as a result of the contact of these two forces: the Torment literally tore off pieces of the Divine, and their fusion gave something in between - which became the world in which everything happens. And since it was the Torment that tore it off, it reigns in the world. It's under Torment's control, BUT cannot completely merge with it, because the divine principle is still present.

                    The Divine wants its piece back, but cannot accept the generation of Torment. So every being (and the world as a whole) must be cleansed through its suffering.

                    Purification can drag on for several rebirths (and therefore a LOT of people are unhappy, because they haven't done anything wrong, but are doomed, possibly to eternal rebirth without the possibility of salvation). Rebirths work like in Buddhism: If you behaved well, you go in a better direction, if not â€” in the opposite.

                    Creature can be reborn as everything: from plants to the undead. The only thing you cannot become is a divine creature, because they are determined.

                    The Deity is not depicted in any way other than as a coming light. Among all peoples there is no culture of depicting a deity in any form other than as a scattered ray. This is not so much a prohibition (although it exists), but rather a general conviction that something so high and distant from their sinful world cannot have the usual forms, much less take the form of low things.
