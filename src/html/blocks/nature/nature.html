                    <h3>Fauna</h3>
                    <p>
                        The fauna of Tormentum boasts a variety of creatures - the births of The Torment, those who were able to adapt and evolve. Species diversity begins with more or less familiar animals - artiodactyls, canines, birds, etc., but we must take into account that they were greatly influenced by the conditions in which they developed. Thus, the majority are distinguished by increased aggressiveness, a changed diet (some herbivores are able to taste flesh), and behavior in packs. And at the same time, The Torment absorbs sufferers into its darkness and gives birth to creatures similar to the undead, species acquire the most bizarre and unusual shapes, sizes and behavior: starting from something between a dead and a human-like and up to complete absorption and creatures of mysterious origin.

                        Some of the vegetation includes common forms such as trees, grass and shrubs. However, the conditions for their survival are very different: the lack of minerals and clean water in the soil makes it difficult for most plants to survive; trees rot before a leaf leaves, grass turns brown due to the blood soaked soil, and flowers cannot thrive in such a bleak environment. Yet, other, equally horrible plants thrive in these horrible conditions.

                        The Torment absorbs sufferers into its darkness and gives birth to creatures similar to the undead of the most bizarre forms: starting from something between a dead and a human and up to complete absorption.

                        Plus the Deity and his charges: a variety of creatures - the highest have the most incomprehensible forms, the lowest have anthropomorphic ones. Many races, so there was racial mixing, which did not lead to anything good.

                    <p>
                        The Torment has more freaks, whose fate is not to be envied - the monstrous essence in them prevails over consciousness. But there were a couple of rare cases when incest was successful (or maybe these are just legends).
