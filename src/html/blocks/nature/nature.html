                        The Torment absorbs sufferers into its darkness and gives birth to creatures similar to the undead of the most bizarre forms: starting from something between a dead and a human and up to complete absorption.

                        The Torment has more individuals with monstrous essence than consciousness, leading to an undesirable fate. Although there are rare legends of successful incest, in 99% of cases, offspring are not viable if they are not of the same species.
