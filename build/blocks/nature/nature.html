                    <h3>Fauna</h3>
                    <p>
                        The fauna of Tormentum boasts a variety of creatures - the births of The Torment, those who were able to adapt and evolve. Species diversity begins with more or less familiar animals - artiodactyls, canines, birds, etc., but we must take into account that they were greatly influenced by the conditions in which they developed. Thus, the majority are distinguished by increased aggressiveness, a changed diet (some herbivores are able to taste flesh), and behavior in packs. And at the same time, The Torment absorbs sufferers into its darkness and gives birth to creatures similar to the undead, species acquire the most bizarre and unusual shapes, sizes and behavior: starting from something between a dead and a human-like and up to complete absorption and creatures of mysterious origin.

            <h4>Dogs</h4>
            <p>There are also other animals in the world that are more familiar to us: wolves, birds, deer and so on. However, due to the nature of the world, as well as the influence of Torment.</p>

        <div class="gallery-text gallery-text-2">
            <h4>Dust monsters</h4>
            <p>Dwell in any abandoned place: empty cities, scorched forests and drained water bodies. They absorb the energies of death and destruction, and favor lost humans and large animals as delicacies.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="gallery-text gallery-text-3">
            <h4>Wasteland & Desert worms</h4>
            <p>Dwell in dry regions, under sands and fossils. They hunt at night when small animals come to the cooled surface. The largest worms prey on wanderers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="gallery-text gallery-text-4">
            <h4>Skull jellyfish</h4>
            <p>They live at the deepest depths and are hardly studied. Legend has it that deep-sea jellyfish absorb what remains of mermaid victims and create a horrible symbiosis</p>

        <div class="gallery-text gallery-text-5">
            <h4>Mermaids</h4>
            <p>Inhabitants of water bodies. Drag to the bottom and kill travelers who have been wrecked. They smell blood from afar and swim to their victims. Their long tentacle tails allow them to move quickly and grab their victims.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="gallery-text gallery-text-6">
            <h4>Summoner or leshii</h4>
            <p>Half-dead creatures that were once endowed with reason, but have lost it over the centuries. Protect the forests and territories they consider their own from the prying eyes of travelers. If blood comes into contact with leshy moss, they will become infected. A person will gradually lose his mind, become covered with mold and moss, rot and eventually turn into the same half-dead creature.</p>

        <div class="gallery-text gallery-text-7">
            <h4>Moths</h4>
            <p>Unpleasant creatures, though some find them enchanting. Not dangerous in themselves, but their parts (e.g. wings or sap) can be used to make quite dangerous poisons</p>
        </div>

            <h4>Forest Fairies</h4>
            <p>They are slightly smaller than a human, have sharp teeth, sometimes horns or antennae-like outgrowths. They hunt small animals and birds, do not like travelers and can attack and seriously injure them.</p>

        <div class="gallery-text gallery-text-9">
            <h4>Pixies and Doxy (small fairies)</h4>
            <p>Less intelligent fairies are small, like annoying pests. They can get attached to travelers, bite them, take away their belongings, and try to lead them into their lairs. A large group of fairies can seriously harm.</p>

                        Some of the vegetation includes common forms such as trees, grass and shrubs. However, the conditions for their survival are very different: the lack of minerals and clean water in the soil makes it difficult for most plants to survive; trees rot before a leaf leaves, grass turns brown due to the blood soaked soil, and flowers cannot thrive in such a bleak environment. Yet, other, equally horrible plants thrive in these horrible conditions.

                        The Torment absorbs sufferers into its darkness and gives birth to creatures similar to the undead of the most bizarre forms: starting from something between a dead and a human and up to complete absorption. Plus the Deity and his charges: a variety of creatures - the highest have the most incomprehensible forms, the lowest have anthropomorphic ones. Many races, so there was racial mixing, which did not lead to anything good. The Torment has more freaks, whose fate is not to be envied - the monstrous essence in them prevails over consciousness. But there were a couple of rare cases when incest was successful (or maybe these are just legends). In any case, in 99% of cases, figs are born, understand that if you are not of the same species.
