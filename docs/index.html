They are equal in their strength, eternity and aspirations. Deity and Torment act together and cannot live without each other.</p><p class="text-left"> The main world was formed as a result of the contact of these two forces: the Torment literally tore off pieces of the Divine, and their fusion gave something in between - which became the world in which everything happens. And since it was the Torment that tore it off, it reigns in the world. It's under Torment's control, BUT cannot completely merge with it, because the divine principle is still present.</p><p class="text-left"> The Divine wants its piece back, but cannot accept the generation of Torment. So every being (and the world as a whole) must be cleansed through its suffering.</p><p class="text-left"> Purification can drag on for several rebirths (and therefore a LOT of people are unhappy, because they haven't done anything wrong, but are doomed, possibly to eternal rebirth without the possibility of salvation). Rebirths work like in Buddhism: If you behaved well, you go in a better direction, if not — in the opposite.</p><p class="text-left"> Creature can be reborn as everything: from plants to the undead. The only thing you cannot become is a divine creature, because they are determined.</p><p class="text-left"> The Deity is not depicted in any way other than as a coming light. Among all peoples there is no culture of depicting a deity in any form other than as a scattered ray. This is not so much a prohibition (although it exists), but rather a general conviction that something so high and distant from their sinful world cannot have the usual forms, much less take the form of low things.</p></div></div></section></div><div class="container"><section class="section section__history" id="history"><h2 class="subtitle">History</h2><div class="map__wrapper"><picture><source srcset="./img/slider-bg/map-bw.webp" type="image/webp"><img class="history-map" src="./img/slider-bg/map-bw.jpeg" alt="Map"></picture></div><div class="history__description"><h5>In the silence of torment, the echoes of our inner battles resound louder than any thunder...</h5><p class="text-left"> The world has existed for a long time, but endless suffering absorbs everything rational.

By the standards of the time of the world of Torment for our years, he was about 17 years old. With no hope of salvation and no one to help him, he faced a choice: stay in a world where suffering was the only reality, or try to find his way to the light his parents believed in and set him free.</p><p class="text-left"> Obsessed with the idea of liberation and the search for salvation, the hero sets out in search of the so-called "saviours" he has heard so much about from his parents. Driven by the hope that the light is still out there, he embarks on a journey, searching for his way to the light in the depths of a world shrouded in Misery.</p><p class="text-left"> Ermys' search for a savior led to an encounter with Girsus the Blatant, who was said to know the way to the deity, but this savior was a loyal servant of Torment and had the least interest in anyone finding true salvation from torment. Instead, he decided to use the hero as another example of a "fool" for the salvation-believing public.</p><p class="text-left"> He gave him a path that supposedly should lead him to the Deity, full of trials and sufferings beyond the power of any living creature. And it was beyond him. He encountered probably powerful dark forces and was swallowed by them.

Thus, the majority are distinguished by increased aggressiveness, a changed diet (some herbivores are able to taste flesh), and behavior in packs.
