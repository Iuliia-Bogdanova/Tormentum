They are equal in their strength, eternity and aspirations. Deity and Torment act together and cannot live without each other.</p><p class="text-left"> The main world was formed as a result of the contact of these two forces: the Torment literally tore off pieces of the Divine, and their fusion gave something in between - which became the world in which everything happens. And since it was the Torment that tore it off, it reigns in the world. It's under Torment's control, BUT cannot completely merge with it, because the divine principle is still present.</p><p class="text-left"> The Divine wants its piece back, but cannot accept the generation of Torment. So every being (and the world as a whole) must be cleansed through its suffering.</p><p class="text-left"> Purification can drag on for several rebirths (and therefore a LOT of people are unhappy, because they haven't done anything wrong, but are doomed, possibly to eternal rebirth without the possibility of salvation). Rebirths work like in Buddhism: If you behaved well, you go in a better direction, if not — in the opposite.</p><p class="text-left"> Creature can be reborn as everything: from plants to the undead. The only thing you cannot become is a divine creature, because they are determined.</p><p class="text-left"> The Deity is not depicted in any way other than as a coming light. Among all peoples there is no culture of depicting a deity in any form other than as a scattered ray. This is not so much a prohibition (although it exists), but rather a general conviction that something so high and distant from their sinful world cannot have the usual forms, much less take the form of low things.</p></div></div></section></div><div class="container"><section class="section section__nature" id="nature"><h2 class="subtitle">Nature</h2><div class="section__nature"><div class="section__nature fauna"><div class="description__fauna"><h3>Fauna</h3><p> The fauna of Tormentum boasts a variety of creatures - the births of The Torment, those who were able to adapt and evolve. Species diversity begins with more or less familiar animals - artiodactyls, canines, birds, etc., but we must take into account that they were greatly influenced by the conditions in which they developed. Thus, the majority are distinguished by increased aggressiveness, a changed diet (some herbivores are able to taste flesh), and behavior in packs. And at the same time, The Torment absorbs sufferers into its darkness and gives birth to creatures similar to the undead, species acquire the most bizarre and unusual shapes, sizes and behavior: starting from something between a dead and a human-like and up to complete absorption and creatures of mysterious origin.</p></div><div class="gallery gallery-fauna"><div class="gallery-container"><div class="gallery-items"><picture><source srcset="./img/nature/nature-fauna-1.webp" type="image/webp"><img class="gallery-item gallery-item-1" src="./img/nature/nature-fauna-1.jpg" data-index="1" alt="Doxy"></picture><picture><source srcset="./img/nature/nature-fauna-2.webp" type="image/webp"><img class="gallery-item gallery-item-2" src="./img/nature/nature-fauna-2.jpg" data-index="2" alt="Fairy"></picture><picture><source srcset="./img/nature/nature-fauna-3.webp" type="image/webp"><img class="gallery-item gallery-item-3" src="./img/nature/nature-fauna-3.jpg" data-index="3" alt="Moths"></picture><picture><source srcset="./img/nature/nature-fauna-4.webp" type="image/webp"><img class="gallery-item gallery-item-4" src="./img/nature/nature-fauna-4.jpg" data-index="4" alt="Summoner"></picture><picture><source srcset="./img/nature/nature-fauna-5.webp" type="image/webp"><img class="gallery-item gallery-item-5" src="./img/nature/nature-fauna-5.jpg" data-index="5" alt="Mermaids"></picture><picture><source srcset="./img/nature/nature-fauna-6.webp" type="image/webp"><img class="gallery-item gallery-item-6" src="./img/nature/nature-fauna-6.jpg" data-index="6" alt="Jellyfish"></picture><picture><source srcset="./img/nature/nature-fauna-7.webp" type="image/webp"><img class="gallery-item gallery-item-7" src="./img/nature/nature-fauna-7.jpg" data-index="7" alt="Worm"></picture><picture><source srcset="./img/nature/nature-fauna-8.webp" type="image/webp"><img class="gallery-item gallery-item-8" src="./img/nature/nature-fauna-8.jpg" data-index="8" alt="Dust"></picture><picture><source srcset="./img/nature/nature-fauna-9.webp" type="image/webp"><img class="gallery-item gallery-item-9" src="./img/nature/nature-fauna-9.jpg" data-index="9" alt="Dogs"></picture></div><div class="gallery-controls"> <button class="gallery-controls-previous"><picture><source srcset="./img/icons/sword.svg" type="image/webp"><img class="default-icon" src="./img/icons/sword.svg" alt="Left"></picture><picture><source srcset="./img/icons/sword-hover.svg" type="image/webp"><img class="hover-icon" src="./img/icons/sword-hover.svg" alt="Left"></picture></button> <button class="gallery-controls-next"><picture><source srcset="./img/icons/sword.svg" type="image/webp"><img class="default-icon" src="./img/icons/sword.svg" alt="Right"></picture><picture><source srcset="./img/icons/sword-hover.svg" type="image/webp"><img class="hover-icon" src="./img/icons/sword-hover.svg" alt="Right"></picture></button></div></div><div class="gallery-texts"><div class="gallery-text gallery-text-1"><h4>Dogs</h4><p>There are also other animals in the world that are more familiar to us: wolves, birds, deer and so on. However, due to the nature of the world, as well as the influence of Torment.</p></div><div class="gallery-text gallery-text-2"><h4>Dust monsters</h4><p>Dwell in any abandoned place: empty cities, scorched forests and drained water bodies. They absorb the energies of death and destruction, and favor lost humans and large animals as delicacies.</p></div><div class="gallery-text gallery-text-3"><h4>Wasteland & Desert worms</h4><p>Dwell in dry regions, under sands and fossils. They hunt at night when small animals come to the cooled surface. The largest worms prey on wanderers.</p></div><div class="gallery-text gallery-text-4"><h4>Skull jellyfish</h4><p>They live at the deepest depths and are hardly studied. Legend has it that deep-sea jellyfish absorb what remains of mermaid victims and create a horrible symbiosis</p></div><div class="gallery-text gallery-text-5"><h4>Mermaids</h4><p>Inhabitants of water bodies. Drag to the bottom and kill travelers who have been wrecked. They smell blood from afar and swim to their victims. Their long tentacle tails allow them to move quickly and grab their victims.</p></div><div class="gallery-text gallery-text-6"><h4>Summoner or leshii</h4><p>Half-dead creatures that were once endowed with reason, but have lost it over the centuries. Protect the forests and territories they consider their own from the prying eyes of travelers. If blood comes into contact with leshy moss, they will become infected. A person will gradually lose his mind, become covered with mold and moss, rot and eventually turn into the same half-dead creature.</p></div><div class="gallery-text gallery-text-7"><h4>Moths</h4><p>Unpleasant creatures, though some find them enchanting. Not dangerous in themselves, but their parts (e.g. wings or sap) can be used to make quite dangerous poisons</p></div><div class="gallery-text gallery-text-8"><h4>Forest Fairies</h4><p>They are slightly smaller than a human, have sharp teeth, sometimes horns or antennae-like outgrowths. They hunt small animals and birds, do not like travelers and can attack and seriously injure them.</p></div><div class="gallery-text gallery-text-9"><h4>Pixies and Doxy (small fairies)</h4><p>Less intelligent fairies are small, like annoying pests. They can get attached to travelers, bite them, take away their belongings, and try to lead them into their lairs.

However, the conditions for their survival are very different: the lack of minerals and clean water in the soil makes it difficult for most plants to survive; trees rot before a leaf leaves, grass turns brown due to the blood soaked soil, and flowers cannot thrive in such a bleak environment. Yet, other, equally horrible plants thrive in these horrible conditions.</p></div><picture><source srcset="./img/nature/flora-img.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="./img/nature/flora-img.jpg" alt="Tree" class="flora-img"></picture></div></div><div class="section__nature races"><div class="description__races"><h3>Races</h3><p> The Torment absorbs sufferers into its darkness and gives birth to creatures similar to the undead of the most bizarre forms: starting from something between a dead and a human and up to complete absorption. Plus the Deity and his charges: a variety of creatures - the highest have the most incomprehensible forms, the lowest have anthropomorphic ones. Many races, so there was racial mixing, which did not lead to anything good. The Torment has more freaks, whose fate is not to be envied - the monstrous essence in them prevails over consciousness. But there were a couple of rare cases when incest was successful (or maybe these are just legends).
