He was part of a humble human family. His parents were ardent followers of the Deity, their faith was their pillar and the reason for their resilience in the face of adversity.Surrounded by the gloomy expanse and the heavy burden of suffering, his parents endeavoured to find light in the darkness that permeated Torment.They died because of their faith by the hands of the guards of Torment, and never even waited for the coming of Diety.</p><p class="text-left">The hero was left alone, deprived of support and defence, in a world consumed by agony. By the standards of the time of the world of Torment for our years, he was about 17 years old. With no hope of salvation and no one to help him, he faced a choice: stay in a world where suffering was the only reality, or try to find his way to the light his parents believed in and set him free.</p><p class="text-left">Obsessed with the idea of liberation and the search for salvation, the hero sets out in search of the so-called "saviours" he has heard so much about from his parents. Driven by the hope that the light is still out there, he embarks on a journey, searching for his way to the light in the depths of a world shrouded in Misery.</p><p class="text-left">Ermys' search for a savior led to an encounter with Girsus the Blatant, who was said to know the way to the deity, but this savior was a loyal servant of Torment and had the least interest in anyone finding true salvation from torment. Instead, he decided to use the hero as another example of a "fool" for the salvation-believing public.</p><p class="text-left">He gave him a path that supposedly should lead him to the Deity, full of trials and sufferings beyond the power of any living creature. And it was beyond him. He encountered probably powerful dark forces and was swallowed by them. But for his suffering and faith according to the system of rebirth the guy was reborn into a demi-deity.</p></div></div></section></div>
