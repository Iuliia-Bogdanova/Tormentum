He was part of a humble human family. His parents were ardent followers of the Deity, their faith was their pillar and the reason for their resilience in the face of adversity.Surrounded by the gloomy expanse and the heavy burden of suffering, his parents endeavoured to find light in the darkness that permeated Torment.They died because of their faith by the hands of the guards of Torment, and never even waited for the coming of Diety.</p><p class="text-left">The hero was left alone, deprived of support and defence, in a world consumed by agony. By the standards of the time of the world of Torment for our years, he was about 17 years old. With no hope of salvation and no one to help him, he faced a choice: stay in a world where suffering was the only reality, or try to find his way to the light his parents believed in and set him free.</p><p class="text-left">Obsessed with the idea of liberation and the search for salvation, the hero sets out in search of the so-called "saviours" he has heard so much about from his parents. Driven by the hope that the light is still out there, he embarks on a journey, searching for his way to the light in the depths of a world shrouded in Misery.</p><p class="text-left">Ermys' search for a savior led to an encounter with Girsus the Blatant, who was said to know the way to the deity, but this savior was a loyal servant of Torment and had the least interest in anyone finding true salvation from torment. Instead, he decided to use the hero as another example of a "fool" for the salvation-believing public.</p><p class="text-left">He gave him a path that supposedly should lead him to the Deity, full of trials and sufferings beyond the power of any living creature. And it was beyond him. He encountered probably powerful dark forces and was swallowed by them. But for his suffering and faith according to the system of rebirth the guy was reborn into a demi-deity.</p></div><div class="cell-text-left"><h3 class="genealogy__subtitle">False Saviours:</h3><h4 class="genealogy__names">Girsus the Blatant</h4><p class="text-left">It is one of the first and still living false saviors.</p><p class="text-left">Once he felt the taste of the filth that obscures the mind, he forever became its helper. His longevity is justified by the fact that his service is profitable and useful to the Torment, since the networks organized by his apostate cause lead more people into oblivion. His appearance is not attractive, but this was not always the case.</p><p class="text-left">Long years of service to the Torment had drained all humanity from his face. Its good that messengers are supposed to hide it…</p></div><div class="cell-img"><picture><source srcset="./img/slider-bg/Girsus.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="./img/slider-bg/Girsus.jpg" alt="Girsus the Blatant" class="history-img"></picture></div><div class="cell-img"><picture><source srcset="./img/slider-bg/history-3.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="./img/slider-bg/history-3.jpg" alt="Bones" class="history-img"></picture></div><div class="cell-text-right"><p class="text-right"> “The Chronicle of the Hegemon” — an idea of history. The belief that all fate is recorded on the scrolls of the Hegemon (the consubstantial guardian of time and the course of events) The myth is depicted differently in different places. There is no single canon of her image, but as a rule it is a young girl with an endless scroll and a feather. Only an apostate does not recognize the Hegemon's power over time and fate, and every believer longs for a meeting and the opportunity to find his own verse in the chronicle.</p></div></div></div></section></div>
